(gcd 206 40)
b is evaluated each time because of the (= b 0) check

(gcd b (remainder a b))

normal order
(gcd 40 (remainder 206 40))
b = 6
(gcd 6 (remainder a 6))
b = 4
(gcd 4 (remainder a 4))
b = 2
(gcd 2 (remainder a 2))
b = 0

remainder performed 4 times

applicative order
(gcd 40 (remainder 206 40))
(gcd 40 6)
(gcd 6 (remainder 40 6))
(gcd 6 4)
(gcd 4 (remainder 6 4))
(gcd 4 2)
(gcd 2 (remainder 4 2))
(gcd 2 0)

remainder performed 4 times


I was expected there to be a difference. Did I do the normal one wrong?
I we don't evaluate b, then we never stop the recursion.
